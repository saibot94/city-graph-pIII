City Graph modeling project
===============

A small OOP Java project that models the transport network of a city using graphs.

===============
Requirement:
Consider the network of tramway and bus lines and corresponding stations in different locations in a town. In some places, there exist multiple stations (tramways and buses) in order to allow changing the line. There is an average travel speed associated with each line.
Requirements:

model all the relevant concepts of the problem; appropriately decide on interfaces, abstract classes, classes; consider reusability, data encapsulation, separation of concerns; PROVIDE A CLASS DIAGRAM;
supposing a person wants to go from one particular place to another, provide him/her with the available connections (do not consider the schedule constraints);
simulate the travel of the person by displaying the station names and waiting between two station proportionally to the average speed on the current line.
