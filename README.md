City Graph modeling project
===============

A small OOP Java project that models the transport network of a city using graphs.

===============

Project #1:
Consider the network of tramway and bus lines and corresponding stations in different locations in a town. In some places, there exist multiple stations (tramways and buses) in order to allow changing the line. There is an average travel speed and cost associated with each line.

Requirements:

   - model all the relevant concepts of the problem; appropriately decide on interfaces, abstract classes, classes; consider reusability, data encapsulation, separation of concerns; PROVIDE A CLASS DIAGRAM;
   - supposing a person wants to go from one particular place to another, provide him/her with ALL the available connections (do not consider the schedule constraints);
   - have the system providing the fastest, shortest and the cheapest way to go from a location to another;
   - simulate the travel of the person by displaying the station names and waiting between two station based on the average speed on the current line. 

Value: 3p

Deadline: November 23th, 2014, 23:59. Missing the deadline up to one week decrease the value of the project with 50%. Missing the deadline with more than one week results in no point awarded for the project.
